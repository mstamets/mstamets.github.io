        <h1>Environmental Diplomacy Index Highlights the Importance of Legislative Tranperancy </h1>
            <p>The most recent release of the Pollution Index of average nation’s pollution rate is 55, this is  down nearly  24 since 2012. This decrease in average pollution of major cities in nations across the world is encouraging, however the recent release of the Environmental Diplomacy Index  indicated that 79% of nations have below average participation provisions. Citizen participation in conjunction with legislation is the key, according to experts, to slowing the environmental damage being caused. The question plaguing many environmentalists is how to gain legislative traction that will lead to widespread conservation and sustainable efforts. </p>
           <p>“This is where providing facts to the public and putting them in context is extremely important,” said San Francisco  Director of Meteorology, Measurement, and Rules, Eric Stevenson, “If we’re able to provide the information to people, they can take informed action with little negative impacts to their lives.” </p>
         <h1>Pollution Index by Nation</h1>

            <p>Governments around the world were ranked by the EDI, which was released by the World resources institute is the first publically available report that tracks national progress in regards to environmental legislation in 70 countries around the world. It measures 75 legislative indicators that  take into account laws, constitutions, regulations and other legally binding, enforceable rules at the national level and 24 additional factors that assess whether there is evidence that environmental democracy is being implemented in practice

However a high EDI, does not always correlate to a low pollution index. Outliers like Peru, have low EDIs but very high pollution rates. Transparency and diplomacy do not indicate a nation that is exceptionally eco-friendly.

          <p>“Transparency is key. When dealing with an issue this severe, taking the government's word is not acceptable. Even with proper legislation, people will begin to cut corners and take cheaper routes. The people who do that need to be held accountable, and the only way to do that is have open information about the changing state of our environment,” said Spencer Renna Crew Manager at the Citizens Campaign for the Environment. According to the EDI, only  29% of the countries assessed have no requirements on the timely release of environmental information to their citizens. </p>
          <p>With some environmental indicators being reported too late, air quality is often not reported at all  because nearly half of the EDI countries do not provide ambient air quality data online for their capital cities.</p>
          <p>“All environmental factors, including water quality and air quality, should be accurately measured because they have a big influence in people's living standard and well-being,” said Hinson Tang, president of Students for a Greener Hofstra, “If the government fails to provide a livable environment to its people, the people should at least have the rights to know what is good and what is contaminated.”</p>
          <p>With only 30 percent of nations with an average or above average participation provisions but into place it is imperative now more than ever that governments provide information that is clear and timely. “We live in a soundbite society and people expect complex ideas to be expressed in short, tight sentences.  Sometimes complexities can’t be boiled down to something short and easy,” said Stevenson. </p>
          <p>Environmental issues are often placed on the back burner and lack the budget they need to fully take root. In a 2015 survey of 1,899 local governments but the International City/County Management Association it was reported that 88% of the jurisdictions surveyed cite lack of funding as a significant or the most significant factor hindering local sustainability efforts. “A big thing for people to understand is the scale of the term "environment" it's large, all encompassing, and heavily damaged. It can only be repaired through immediate and drastic policy changes brought on by legislation,” said Renna.</p>
